# Time Tracker

## Introduction

With a touch of an iPhone or Apple Watch, TimeTracker starts or stops the time for a particular activity.

TimeTracker has the following goals:
* Support multiple categories such as work or Kindergarten.
* Track the amount of hours and minutes that has passed between the user pressing the start and stop buttons for a particular day.
* Take an amount for a week and calculate how much of these hours have been used.
* The above can be fulfilled with an easy interface with minimal buttons or presses on either an iPhone or Apple Watch.

TimeTracker has two components. An iOS App which provides the functionality for an iPhone. An Watch App which provides the functionality for an Apple Watch.

### iOS App

The iOS App is stored in the TimeTrackerApp folder and can be built via XCode.

### WatchOS App

The WatchOS App is stored in the TimeTrackerApp folder and can be built via XCode.
